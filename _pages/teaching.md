# Instructor

## ECON 370: Economic Applications of Data Science 

Designed and taught ECON 370, the first course in the [**DATA credential**](https://econ.unc.edu/undergraduate/data-science-credential/) for undergraduate UNC economics majors. The course is intended for students to learn the R programming language to work with real world data, *assuming no prior coding experience.* Economic applications were used as examples to help students improve their base R skills and highlight the importance of programming in economics. Applications included auction simulation and solving basic optimization problems (e.g. utility maximization, OLS) numerically using [**optim**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/optim.html). After the introduction to base R, I taught students the most common packages for working with data in R such as [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org) in the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) and [**data.table**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html). I concluded the course by teaching students how to communicate their data visually using [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) and how to produce write-ups of their findings using [**R Markdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). Any remaining time was used to teach them basic machine learning models such as clustering with K-means and EM. &nbsp; <a href="http://alexmarsh.io/files/ECON370_Syllabus_Fall2023.pdf" class="btn btn--primary btn--small btn--half">Syllabus</a>

<summary><strong>Course Description</strong></summary>
<blockquote>  
ECON 370 is intended to provide a broad-based introduction to numerical and data-science methods commonly used in economics. The course will first introduce students to the R programming language, assuming no prior experience.  Subsequent lectures will provide students an opportunity to apply this knowledge on real-world data to achieve an economic objective.  The methods used in these applications will include (but are not limited to): collecting, cleaning, merging, processing, and visualizing data, descriptive analysis, optimization, and supervised/unsupervised statistical learning. In addition, the course has an experiential component that connects students with industry leaders in economic applications of data-science through a series of on-campus events.

# Teaching Assistant
## ECON 101: Introduction to Economics
 
 Served as a teaching assistant for ECON 101: Intro to Economics with Dr. Robert McDonough, which is around an 800 person class at UNC. My main responsibility was leading two recitation sections where students worked on more in-depth practice problems than those seen in lecture. After students first attempted the problems with a partner, I walked through the solutions with an eye towards providing clear explanations to students to assist them in developing a deeper understanding of the material. 
  
 **Semesters Taught**: Spring 2024
  
<details>
<summary><strong>Course Description</strong></summary>
<blockquote>  
 ECON 101 is an introductory course in microeconomics and macroeconomics. In this course students are introduced to the basic theory and models that economists use to analyze the world. The concepts introduced include comparative advantage and the gains from trade; supply, demand, and the market system; the theory of the firm; market failures; national income and its determination; inflation and unemployment; economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.

## ECON 470: Econometrics

Served as a teaching assistant for ECON 470: Econometrics with Dr. David Guilkey. Duties included holding office hours, grading exams, and walking students through the exam solutions in the next class meeting. Topics included linear regression estimation with ordinary least squares, instrumental variable regressions, discrete dependent variable models, and models for longitudinal data. 

**Semesters Taught**: Spring 2023

<details>
<summary><strong>Course Description</strong></summary>
<blockquote>  
Econometrics is the application of statistical methods and economic theory to the problem of identifying, estimating, and testing economic models. This course covers concepts and methods used in empirical economic research. Topics include the classical single-equation regression model, multiple regression models, discrete and categorical dependent variables, instrumental variables and longitudinal data. Students will learn the theory and assumptions behind each of the estimation methods so that they can determine the appropriate method for any particular analysis. In the lectures, there will be many empirical examples using a wide variety of data sets that are either cross sectional or longitudinal.
