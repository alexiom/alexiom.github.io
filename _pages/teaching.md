    	He provided plenty of time in class to answer questions and consistently held office hours that were very helpful. Showing us real time in R what he was doing was also very helpful.

#### Course Description 

<blockquote>  
ECON 370 is intended to provide a broad-based introduction to numerical and data-science methods commonly used in economics. The course will first introduce students to the R programming language, assuming no prior experience.  Subsequent lectures will provide students an opportunity to apply this knowledge on real-world data to achieve an economic objective.  The methods used in these applications will include (but are not limited to): collecting, cleaning, merging, processing, and visualizing data, descriptive analysis, optimization, and supervised/unsupervised statistical learning. In addition, the course has an experiential component that connects students with industry leaders in economic applications of data-science through a series of on-campus events.

# Teaching Assistant
## ECON 101: Introduction to Economics
 
 Served as a teaching assistant for ECON 101 which is around an 800 person class at UNC. My main responsibility was leading two recitation sections where students worked on more in-depth practice problems than those seen in lecture. Walked through solutions after students first attempted the problems with a partner. Responsible for providing clear explanations to students in hopes of them developing a deeper understanding of the material.
