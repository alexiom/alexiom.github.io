Blog
======

[My personal blog can be found here.](https://alexmarsh.io/blog) This is still a work in progress, and I plan to post about anything I find interesting. I foresee its primary focus to revolve around economics and antitrust; however, it may brach off into other topics such as academia, philosophy of science, and discussion of my hobbies.

Hobbies
======

When I am not working, I enjoy running and lifting weights, playing guitar, tabletop roleplaying games, and reading, particularly fantasy and horror. I am an avid Nashville Predators hockey fan even if it ultimately results in heartbreak.
