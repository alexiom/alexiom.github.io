## Blog

[My personal blog can be found here.](https://alexmarsh.io/blog) This is a work in progress, and I plan to post about anything I find interesting. I foresee its primary focus to revolve around economics and antitrust; however, it may brach off into other topics such as academia, philosophy of science, and discussion of my hobbies.

## Hobbies

When I am not working, I enjoy running and lifting weights, playing guitar, tabletop roleplaying games, and reading. I am an avid Nashville Predators hockey fan even if it ultimately results in heartbreak.

### Dungeons and Dragons

Code that I have written for various purposes in Dungeons and Dragons can be found [here.](https://github.com/alexiom/DND_Code) This includes simulations for determining when to use sharpshooter with various characters of mine and creating a hoard following the random tables in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons*.

### Goodreads

[This is a link to my Goodreads account.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164916455-alex-marsh) While I have many reading interests, I am particularly interested in fantasy and horror.
