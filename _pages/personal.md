When I am not working, I enjoy running and lifting weights, playing guitar, tabletop roleplaying games, and reading, particularly fantasy and horror. I am an avid Nashville Predators hockey fan even if it ultimately results in heartbreak. 

Dungeons and Dragons

Code that I have written for various purposes in Dungeons and Dragons can be found [here.](https://github.com/alexiom/DND_Code) This includes simulations for determining when to use sharpshooter with various characters of mine and creating a hoard following the random tables in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons*.
