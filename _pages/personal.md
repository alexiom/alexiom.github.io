<h2 id="blog" style="margin-top: 0;">Blog</h2>

[My personal blog can be found here.](https://alexmarsh.io/blog) This is a work in progress, and I plan to post about anything I find interesting. I foresee its primary focus to revolve around economics and antitrust; however, it may brach off into other topics such as academia, philosophy of science, and discussion of my hobbies.

## Hobbies

Outside of work, I enjoy running, lifting weights, playing guitar, tabletop roleplaying games, and reading.

I do enjoy sports; however, I only follow specific teams. At the professional level, those teams are the Cincinnati Bengals, Cincinnati Reds, and Nashville Predators even if my support has only ever been rewarded with heartbreak in my lifetime. At the collegiate level, my loyalty to UNC and Duke is, admittedly, complicated. I cheer for both teams-except when they face each other. In those moments, my six years of funded doctoral education at UNC tips the scales, despite having first experienced the rivalry as a Duke student. However, both programs is trumped by my loyalty to Belmont Men's Basketball, who has given both <a href="https://belmontbruins.com/sports/mens-basketball/opponent-history/university-of-north-carolina/12">UNC</a> and <a href="https://belmontbruins.com/sports/mens-basketball/opponent-history/duke-university/6">Duke</a> competitive games in the past, with Belmont beating UNC on November 17, 2013. 

### Goodreads

[This is a link to my Goodreads account.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164916455-alex-marsh) While I have many reading interests, I am particularly interested in fantasy and horror.


### Dungeons and Dragons

I enjoy tabletop roleplaying games with Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition being the one I have the most familiarity. I am currently developing a Greek Mythology/Ancient Greece inspired campaign loosely based on the official Theros book. It will only rely on the Open Game License, and I plan to make it publicly available when it is ready.

Code that I have written for various purposes in D\&D 5e can be found [here.](https://github.com/alexiom/DND_Code) This includes simulations for determining when to use sharpshooter with various characters of mine and creating a hoard following the random tables in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons*.
