## Blog

[My personal blog can be found here.](https://alexmarsh.io/blog) This is a work in progress, and I plan to post about anything I find interesting. I foresee its primary focus to revolve around economics and antitrust; however, it may brach off into other topics such as academia, philosophy of science, and discussion of my hobbies.

## Hobbies

When I am not working, I enjoy running, lifting weights, playing guitar, tabletop roleplaying games, and reading.

I do enjoy following specific sports teams. At the professional level, I follow the Cincinnati Bengals, Cincinnati Reds, and Nashville Predators even if though doing so ultimately results in heartbreak. At the collegiate level, my loyalty for UNC and Duke athletics is complicated. I will root for both teams except for when they play each other, at which time, my doctoral funding and time at UNC beats out my introduction to the rivalry from attending Duke first.

### Dungeons and Dragons

Code that I have written for various purposes in Dungeons and Dragons can be found [here.](https://github.com/alexiom/DND_Code) This includes simulations for determining when to use sharpshooter with various characters of mine and creating a hoard following the random tables in *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons*.

### Goodreads

[This is a link to my Goodreads account.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164916455-alex-marsh) While I have many reading interests, I am particularly interested in fantasy and horror.
