				<p> We analyze consumer search and purchase behavior using data from a major airline's website over a 6-month period in 2022 and 2023. We find large increases in demand for one-way and nonstop service from single adults and upper-tier loyalty members as the flight departure approaches. Later searches are more likely to result in purchases, consistent with traditional assumptions about business and emergency travelers arriving to airline markets closer to departure dates. We observe that consumers sometimes search for multiple destinations and departure dates within and across browsing sessions, and some consumers are redirected to the airline's website from metasearch websites. By combining the web-traffic data with contemporaneous information from Google Flights, we show that stronger competition results in a more selected sample of consumers to the airline's website and reduces the probability of purchase. Those consumers redirected to the site from metasearch websites are less likely to purchase. We discuss how our findings apply to current models of air-travel demand.
