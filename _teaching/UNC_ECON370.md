Designed and taught ECON 370, the first course in the DATA credential for undergraduate UNC economics majors.

## Course Information

- **Institution**: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- **Date**: Fall 2021, Fall 2022, Fall 2023
- **Instructor**: Alex Marsh
- [**Syllabus**](http://alexmarsh.io/files/ECON370_Syllabus_Fall2023.pdf)
- **Description**: ECON 370 is intended to provide a broad-based introduction to numerical and data-science methods commonly used in economics.   The course will first introduce students to the R programming language, assuming no prior experience.  Subsequent lectures will provide students an opportunity to apply this knowledge on real-world data to achieve an economic objective.  The methods used in these applications will include (but are not limited to): collecting, cleaning, merging, processing, and visualizing data, descriptive analysis, optimization, and supervised/unsupervised statistical learning. In addition, the course has an experiential component that connects students with industry leaders in economic applications of data-science through a series of on-campus events.
