Served as a teaching assistant for ECON 101 which is around an 800 person class at UNC. My main responsibility was leading two recitation sections where students worked on more in-depth practice problems than those seen in lecture. Walked through solutions after students first attempted the problems with a partner. Responsible for providing clear explanations to students in hopes of them developing a deeper understanding of the material.
